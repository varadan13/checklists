## Manage like an Engineer

- Make work visible - Proactively share to the widest extent practical given the subject.4 Like any production system, observability is key.
- Write things down - Especially the why and how. Ensure that everything has a URL. Be generous with links.
- Over communicate - Use a durable, searchable, and discoverable medium. Let others opt-in to context and subscribe to updates.
- Bias for shipping - Ship early, ship often. Whether decisions, process, or “manager code”, ship an MVP and iterate. Minimize batch size.
- Streamline and automate - Never force a human to do what a robot can. Prefer non-blocking over blocking operations. Codify policy as code.
- Embrace collaboration - How we work is as important as what we work on. Software development is a team sport.5
- Asynchronous first - Reserve higher-fidelity mediums for conversations that require them.
- Practicality beats purity - These are guidelines, not rules. Process should drive outcomes.


- Issues - Issues are the atomic unit of work across teams and is the primary means by which work is planned, tracked, coordinated, and communicated, and where updates are shared.7
- Project boards - Project boards are the primary means by which work (in the form of issues) is organized, managed, prioritized, and made visible.
- Markdown files - Markdown files are the primary means by which long-lived information is memorialized. Markdown files are created and modified via Pull Requests.
- Pull requests - Pull requests are the primary means by which proposals are reviewed and decisions are made.
